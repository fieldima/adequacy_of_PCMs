# Analysis of the Adequacy of Widely Used Phylogenetic Models in Gene Expression Data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

The analyses in this document were run on 9 different gene expression data sets, outlined in the README file in this repository. These data sets are of hundreds of different species and tens of thousands of different genes. Some analyses were run using the species-level phylogeny, while others were run using individual gene-level phylogenies. The models interrogated in this analysis include the Brownian Motion model depicting random walk of a character trait, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model depicting random walk with a constraint value, and the Early Burst model depicting random walk with a slowing down of evolutionary rate as time passes. A fourth model is added, Brownian Motion with multiple rates, that allows different branches of the tree to have separate evolutionary rate parameters but is otherwise Brownian Motion. In the literature, each of these models is often used as a stand-in of an evolutionary process; Brownian Motion as neutral drift, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck as stabilizing selection, and Early Burst as adaptive radiation. The selection of a model as the "dominant model" through various model-selection processes is then often used to state that stabilizing selection is the dominant mode of evolution for some set of genes for example. Rather than make specific claims about the results of each paper, this analysis aims to understand and highlight patterns of model adequacy in the field; i.e., do the models we are using actually describe the variation in the data? Or is there much left to be desired?

## Summary

By using the Akaike Information Criterion to measure relative fit, I show that broadly, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model is the best fit for most of the data; i.e., the model with the lowest AIC for each gene is most often OU by a fair margin. In the absolute sense, most of the data was adequately modeled by the best-fit model (most commonly OU), but these models were very often inadequate in terms of rate heterogeneity. I then ran simulations to show that processes that truly had multiple rate parameters would violate the same test statistics as seen in the data. To solve this I then added a fourth model to the analysis; multi-rate Brownian Motion. In a relative sense, addition of the model then shifted the domination to this multirate BM so that most of the data was best-fit by a multi-rate model. In an absolute sense, it did somewhat reduce issues with rate heterogeneity, but other issues still persist. All in all, it seems that in general, rate heterogeneity is not being accounted for in the most commonly used models of evolution in the field, and usage of those types of models would improve data capture.

## Simulations Illustrate Expected Inadequacy Patterns

To visualize patterns I expect to see when data is adequate or inadequate, I first performed a set of simulations. In these simulations, the generating model varies, but the model being fit to the data stays consistent. In this way, I can determine where I can expect a model to be inadequate when the true model does not align with the model we are trying to fit. Specifically, the model being fit is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; the model most commonly used in Phylogenetic Comparative Methods. The results of these simulations are depicted below.

![](Arbutus_Exploration/violin_all_models.png)

**Figure 1. Model Adequacy when a series of processes are fit to a model that is not the true one.** P values are depicted on the y-axis and each test statistic is labeled. The generating models are listed in the legend on the right, where models starting with "M" are variants of an OU process with multiple optima or multiple alpha values.

The models tested in these simulations include BM, BMS (multiple rate brownian motion), EB, OU, and multiple optima OU variants with either multiple alpha values (MA), evolutionary rates (MV), or both (MVA).

C.var is the coefficient of variation, used to test if rate heterogeneity is accounted for by a fitted model. As shown by the simulation, a process that is truly Early Burst will show stark inadequacies in this test statistic; notice the high build-up of p-values near 0.05.

## Support For Currently Used Models

Based on my analysis there is evidence supporting the usage of the models mentioned above, specifically the OU model. The amalgamated data set is the largest data set showing support for the models above. This is an amalgamation of 1903 RNA Seq studies with 6 organs and 21 vertebrate species. In a relative sense, the data was best fit by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model and in the absolute sense, test statistics show wide distributions; suggesting adequacy of the model in all 5 aspects. The adequacy analyses are shown below.

![A](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure2a.png)

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure2b.png)

**Figure 2. Relative Fit of the three tested models (top) and Absolute Fit of the best-fit model (bottom) for Amalgamated Data.** The bulk of the data was best fit by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The adequacy of the best fit model for each gene was high across the tested statistics, with evenly distributed test statistics across the board.

As shown by Figure 2, the amalgamated data set showed high adequacy for the best-fit model, which tended to be the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. This supports the current paradigm of PCMs across different species and thousands of genes. In fact, 77% of genes were shown to be fully adequate across all statistics, which increases to 96% when including genes with only one inadequacy.

One of the goals of this analysis was to identify models that may describe gene expression data better in the context of phylogenetic comparative analysis. In the "Coevolution" data set, the author used a BM model to identify evidence of coevolution of proteins across 18 fungi species. I then performed arbutus analysis of the expression data after fitting to a BM model to see how well the model explains the variation in the data. A summary of the analysis is shown below.

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure3.png)

**Figure 3. Number of genes by number of inadequacies (cut off of 0.05) across test statistics for Coevolution data set.** Just over half of the data is adequately modeled by a BM process, with some of the genes being inadequate in all test statistics.

I then performed relative fit analysis to see if there were models that explained the data better, with my results shown below.

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure4.png)

**Figure 4. Count of the model with the lowest AIC value for each gene in the Coevolution data set.** The OU model is overwhelmingly supported by the data.

Finally, I performed arbutus analysis on the best fit model for each gene.

**Figure 5. Number of genes by number of inadequacies (cut off of 0.05) across test statistics for Coevolution data set when using the best fit model.** Genes across the board show great decreases in overall inadequacy.

## Species Phylogenies Are More Adequate Than Gene Family Phylogenies

One interesting finding from the analysis of the Coevolution data set was just how adequate the data was compared to data analyzed in previous studies. A previous analysis found current models to be quite inadequate to describe gene expression data. This analysis is recreated in the Comparative Expression repository. One major difference between these studies was the usage of a species phylogenetic tree in the case of the Coevolution data set, in contrast to gene-family phylogenies in the comparative expression data. To uncover if this adequacy difference was due to the difference in methodologies; I, along with Doris Wu, re-analyzed the Coevolution data set substituting the species relationships with gene-family phylogenies, so that each group of genes was described by the relationship between those genes. The generation of the gene family phylogenetic trees is described in this [repository](https://github.com/pennell-lab-ubc/gene-phylogeny-pipeline). The summary of the arbutus analysis of this data set is shown below.

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure6.png)

**Figure 6. Inadequacies Found When Using Gene Family Phylogenies.** There are more inadequate genes across the board, but less NA values.

This comparison was also carried out in the Mammal Organs data set. The p-value distributions for the test statistics are displayed below.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
pvals_genefamily <- readRDS("Mammal_organs/gene_family_phylogenies/arbutus/pvals/pvals_br") %>% select(!m.sig) %>% mutate(phylo = "Gene Familes")
pvals_species <- readRDS("Mammal_organs/species_phylogeny/arbutus/pvals_br") %>% select(!m.sig) %>% mutate(phylo = "Species")

pvals_both <- full_join(pvals_genefamily, pvals_species)

to_plot <- pvals_both %>% pivot_longer(cols = (!phylo), names_to = "test.stat", values_to = "pvalue")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

to_plot %>% ggplot(aes(x = pvalue)) + geom_histogram() + facet_grid(rows = vars(phylo), cols = vars(test.stat)) + theme_bw()
```

**Figure 7. Comparison of Test Statistic Distributions When Using Gene Family Phylogenies vs Species Phylogenies in Analyzing Adequacy of Mammal Organs Expression Data.** The inadequacies seen in c.var and s.asr appear to be higher when using species phylogenetic relationships, but inadequacies in s.var and s.hgt increase when using gene family phylogenies.

As shown by the figure above, inadequacies increase in certain aspects, but decrease in others. Interestingly, using a species phylogeny seems to cause many genes to show no phylogenetic signal; shown by the drop off in p values near the low end for s.hgt, which was also seen in the Coevolution data set. This was confirmed in the Coevolution data set to be due to low phylogenetic signal in the plot below.

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure8.png)

**Figure 8. Phylogenetic Signal of Genes with NA Values in the S.hgt statistic have Low Phylogenetic Signal.** The K value describes phylogenetic signal where higher values indicate higher signal and the p-values are the result of a hypothesis test where p-values of 0.05 are genes with phylogenetic signal.

In contrast, using gene family phylogenies in analysis causes genes that have no phylogenetic signal when using a species phylogeny to have signal, but they are inadequate in the S.hgt statistic. This statistic shows inadequacies when trait variation over time is not accounted for.

Together, it seems that using gene family phylogenies over species phylogenies increases the amount of inadequacies in a set of data, but this increase may be only due to NA values showing up as inadequate p-values. This suggests that using a species phylogeny can allow the best-fit model to describe the data better statistically (for genes not thrown out for NA p values), but at the expense of the phylogenetic signal of many genes, which may decrease the ability to make biological inferences. In essence, because the species phylogeny is an average and summation of the relationships between all the genes, it is often a "close enough" tree, but for genes that do not fully follow the relationship at the species level, the model that describes their evolution may be misleading.

## Many Data Sets Show Model Inadequacy For Rate Heterogeneity

While the best-fit model for some data sets has been shown to be highly adequate, many of the other data sets in this analysis showed similar patterns in where the best-fit models tended to fail.

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure9a.png)

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure9b.png)

**Figure 9. P-value Distributions of Arbutus Test Statistics for Extremophile Fishes Data Set (top) and Cichlids Data Set (bottom).** Inadequacies are seen in all test statistics except for d.cdf, but most notably in c.var and s.asr for extremophile fishes, whereas the cichlids data set shows inadequacies in mainly c.var, d.cdf, and s.asr.

In general, the most commonly violated test statistics are the coefficient of variation (c.var) and the statistic of ancestral state reconstruction (s.asr) as shown by Figure 7 and 9. These test statistics both tend to be violated together, and are both in some way related to heterogeneity in evolutionary rate over the tree. Going back to Figure 1, these test statistics are both violated when the true model has multiple rates, but the fitted model does not (MV and MVA). The simplest multi-rate model is the BMS, or multiple rate BM, so I ran simulations to see what p-value distributions would look like if the true model were multirate BM, and the other, single-rate models were fit.

![](Arbutus_Exploration/Figures/multirate_comparison.png)

**Figure 10. P value Distributions of Each Test Statistic When the True Model is BMS.** The fitted models are listed in the legend to the side. Both C.var and S.asr show clusters of low pvalues when the fitted model is any other model than BMS.

As shown by the simulation, fitting models with one evolutionary rate regime (BM, OU, EB) to a truly multi-rate process would also generate high inadequacies in the C.var and S.asr test statistics, confirming this as a possible cause of inadequacies in data. I then tested the addition of a BMS process to the Arbutus Analysis process on multiple data sets.

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure11.png)

**Figure 11. Addition of the BMS model lowers adequacy violations in C.var and S.asr in Extremophile Fish data.** More violations are seen in the s.hgt statistic and s.var statistic when a BMS model is included in analysis.

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure12.png)

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure12b.png)

**Figure 12. Addition of a BMS Model to Analysis Increases the Amount of Genes with No Inadequacies in Extremophile Fish Data.** Genes with 3 or more inadequacies showed little change with the addition of a BMS model.

This same pattern of increasing the proportion of genes with fully adequate models by mainly decreasing inadequacies in C.var and S.asr was also seen in the Interspecific RNA Seq data set.

One issue with using a model with multiple evolutionary rates is the need to pre-define selective regimes. This means that one would have to have some biological question or knowledge specific to a set of taxa. However, when broadly analyzing the adequacy of models themselves over the field, this leaves the problem of how to define evolutionary regimes to allow for comparison between data sets. In cases where the authors of the original study made inferences about evolutionary regimes, I simply used those. However, for data sets such as the Snake Venom and Cichlids data sets, I instead used the Motmot tool. This tool identifies clades that experience a shift in evolutionary rate through multiple hypothesis testing. The results of using motmot combined with Arbutus are shown below.

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure13.png)

![](Overall_Analysus_Plots/figure13b.png)

**Figure 13. Adequacy of the Best Fit Model for Snake Venom Data (top) and Cichlids Data (bottom) with and without inclusion of BMS models to Analysis.** Adequacy increased for snake venom genes, but no change was seen in cichlids data.

Overall, the addition of multi-rate BM models to arbutus analysis did increase the adequacy of the best-fit model for the data. Specifically, it decreased issues with C.var and S.asr, which both detect violations when there are issues with evolutionary rate heterogeneity across a tree. However, the magnitude of this increase ranges from moderate (Figure 12) to very little (Figure 13). Thus, factors other than rate heterogeneity seem to be coming into play that is causing models to be inadequate even with the addition of a model that allows for multiple evolutionary rates. Early Burst models were shown to be violated in this test statistic as well (Figure 1), suggesting that one of these factors may be "static" evolutionary rates that are seen in all the models used except for EB.

## Conclusion

Model adequacy is the ability of a model to explain the variation seen in a set of data. More adequate models allow researchers to make better predictions about some statistical process. In this case, the models we are using are proxies for evolutionary processes such as neutral drift, adaptive selection, divergent evolution, etc. Phylogenetic Comparative Methods rely on such models to make claims about the evolution of organisms, but these methods have not been extensively evaluated in the context of gene expression data. In this analysis I have shown that of the three models widely used in the field today, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model tends to be the best-fit model for much of the data in a relative sense. In an absolute sense, the results are mixed. For data sets that use a species phylogeny as the basis, the model does a relatively adequate job. While this is good news statistically, the adequacy of this model tends to decrease a fair amount when a more accurate gene family phylogeny is used for each gene studied. This suggests that using a species phylogeny may allow the current models to perform well statistically, it may decrease the predictive power or ability for biological inference. Additionally, when these models do fail, they tend to be related to issues with heterogeneity in evolutionary rate. Simulation data showed that fitting data that is truly multi-rate with a single rate model recreated these patterns. Addition of a multi-rate model to analysis did somewhat alleviate the inadequacies with rate heterogeneity, but it did not eliminate them. Therefore, other factors may be at play. These factors may include differences in gene expression normalization, static evolutionary rates, batch effects, etc. I suggest that models that account for intraspecific variation, such as the EvoGeneX modified OU model, may further alleviate such model inadequacies, allowing researchers to make better inferences on evolutionary data.
