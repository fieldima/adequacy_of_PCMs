# Arbutus_Exploration

In this directory I worked on exploring the properties of arbutus and what each of the test statistics explains about the data. The directories are as below:

 - EB_tests: My tests with figuring out how to correctly simulate and fit Early Burst models. 
 - Exploration_Scripts: The scripts for each part of my exploration. Includes versions 1, 2, and 3 of the main script. 
 - Figures: Mainly contains plots depicting the results from arbutus simulations.
 - OU_Parameter_Test: Contains folders regarding the testing of each of the parameters of the OU model and how they affect arbutus adequacies.
 - RDSfiles: Saved RDS objects used in the scripts.
