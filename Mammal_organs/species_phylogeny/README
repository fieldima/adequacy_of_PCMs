In this directory, I will be analyzing the gene expression data using the known species phylogeny, which I will build from gene sequence. 

The species are: Human Chimpanzee Gorilla Orangutan Macaque Mouse Opossum Platypus Chicken

I will use a species tree provided by TimeTree http://www.timetree.org/

Note: First run I averaged RPKM values, which may not be advised. Will try to with each of the values separately. (Jan 16, 2022)

To do:
Run whole process with SE values used
Fit just OU
Check what p-values EB datasets have
If inconclusive, fit just EB
